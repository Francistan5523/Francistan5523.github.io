    <div class="title">Software Talks: An Interview with Lev Manovich</div>

    <div class="quote">Lev Manovich is a leading theorist in cultural objects</div>
    <div class="quote">produced by Digital Technology</div>

    <div class="title2">How does one study software? Or what do you study</div>
    <div class="title2"> - the interface or the code or a mixture of both?</div>

    <p>The goal of my book is to understand media software</p>
    <p>- genealogy (the where), its anatomy (the key features)</p>  
    <p>and its effects on the world;</p>

    <p>How design software shapes the media, making some design choices</p>
    <p>easy and natural whilst hiding others</p>

    <p>How media viewing, managing, remixing software shapes our experiences</p>
    <p>and our actions</p>

    <p>The primary case studies are After Effects, Photoshop and Google Earth</p>

    <div class="width50">

    <p>I want to understand what the media is today. Do the concepts of media</p>
    <p>developed for industrial era-technologies apply to video or do they</p>
    <p>need to be updated?</p>

    <p>Do we have different media or did they merge into a single new medium?</p>
    <p>Motion, graphic design, web sites, product designs, buildings and</p>
    <p>video games are all designed with software</p>

    <div class="bold">Does ‘Media’ still exist?</div>

    <p>It's about asking broad questions, not just code or interface.</p> 
    <p>Our world, media, economy and social relations all run on software.</p>

    <div class="title">Looking at historical precedents, what</div>
    <div class="title">extent were you able to engage with the</div> 
    <div class="title">original software or documentation thereof?</div>
    <div class="title">To what extent were you relying on written</div>
    <div class="title"> texts by these early figures</div>

    <div class="width50">
        <img src="2.pdf" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>Theoretical ideas from 1960s and 1970s which led to modern media</p>
    <p>authoring environments and common features of interface. Sutherland</p>
    <p>and his collaborators demonstrated with Sketchpad - the first</p>
    <p>interactive drawing system seen by the public.</p>

    <p>There is overall little documentation of the key systems with small</p>
    <p>black and white illustrations and just a few low resolution clips.</p>

    <p>The situation is quite different from media technologies, you could</p>
    <p>go to a museum to experience a real panorama from the 1840s. With</p>
    <p>computer systems, most ideas come from contemporary media studies but</p>
    <p>the original systems are not accesible. Though since there are a number</p>
    <p>of artists and programmers who work in 'Software Art' and 'Creative Coding',</p>
    <p>it should be possible to create emulations of a few fundamental systems.</p>

    <div class="title">An early concept in your book in Alan Kay's</div>
    <div class="title">concept "Dynabook", which posited a computer</div>
    <div class="title">as 'personal dynamic media' to be used by all.</div>
    <div class="title">It was brought into fruition in the Xerox Alto</div>
    <div class="title">computer, what importance can we attach to</div>
    <div class="title">these images of users, interfaces and objects</div>
    <div class="title">produced by these systems?</div>

    <div class="width50">
        <img src="3.pdf" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>The most informative images from the Dynabook appears in an article also</p>
    <p>written with Adele Goldberg in 1977. Kay suggested that computers can be</p>
    <p>a medium for personal expression.</p>

    <p>Alan Turing defined a computer as a machine that can simulate a large class</p>
    <p>of other machines. It was Kay and his generation that extended the idea of</p>
    <p>simulation to the media. In a book, it simulates existing media that has a</p>
    <p>chance to add and extend new functions. For example, an electronic book</p>
    <p>needs to be treated as a simulated paper book as it is a new medium with</p>
    <p>new properties.</p>

    <p>Many images of media software developed by Xerox team and other Alto users</p>
    <p>illustrate these ideas, Kay and Goldberg provided examples of their Dynabook</p>
    <p>that could allow users to paint, draw, animate, compose music and text. This</p>
    <p>makes Alto the first Universal Media Machine, a computer offering the ability</p>
    <p>to create experiences and artefacts in that sense.</p>

    <div class="title">I find it interesting your approach in analysing</div>
    <div class="title">specific elements of interface and operations.</div>
    <div class="title">Using the example of Sketchpad, was it not</div>
    <div class="title">documentation that allowed for the argument</div>
    <div class="title">that early software was not merely simulations</div>
    <div class="title">of drawings but reinventions of it?</div>

    <div class="width50">
        <img src="4.pdf" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>The Sketchpad demo has visceral impact. Where does it lead with analysis of</p>
    <p>Drawing, Film, Photography.</p>

    <p>The properties of different mediums are properties of media includes:</p>
    <p>Interface, tools and techniques they make possible for navigating, creating,</p>
    <p>editing, and sharing documents.</p>

    <p>For example, being able to change from Adobe Reader to Microsoft Word is not</p>
    <p>the property of text documents, but a result of software techniques.</p>

    <p>There are some media independent techniques such as the search bar, whereas</p>
    <p>some media specific are exclusive for some. For example, you can extrude a</p>
    <p>2 Dimensional shape to 3 Dimensions but not extrude text.</p>

    <div class="quote">I prefer to study the software and use this understanding</div>
    <div class="quote">in interpreting the content created through these medias</div>
    <div class="quote"> - tweets, messages, photos, designs, video games.</div>

    <p>All cultural forms which require a user to click even once, to access</p>
    <p>or participate. Therefore we can't ignore technology, therefore </p>
    <p>software takes command.</p>
