            <div class="title2">How does one study software? Or what do you study - the interface 
                or the code or a mixture of both</div>
        
            <p>The goal of my book is to understand media software
                - genealogy (the where), its anatomy (the key features)
                and its effects on the world;</p>
        
            <p>How design software shapes the media, making some design choices
                easy and natural whilst hiding others. How media viewing, managing,
                remixing software shapes our experiences and our actions</p>
        
            <p>The primary case studies are After Effects, Photoshop and Google Earth</p>

            <p>I want to understand what the media is today. Do the concepts of media 
                developed for industrial era-technologies apply to video or do they 
                need to be updated?</p>
        
            <p>Do we have different media or did they merge into a single new medium?
                Motion, graphic design, web sites, product designs, buildings and 
                video games are all designed with software</p>
        
            <div class="bold">Does ‘Media’ still exist?</div>
        
            <p>It's about asking broad questions, not just code or interface.
                Our world, media, economy and social relations all run on software.</p>
        
            <div class="title">Looking at historical precedents, what
                extent were you able to engage with the
                original software or documentation thereof?
                To what extent were you relying on written
                 texts by these early figures</div>

            <p>Theoretical ideas from 1960s and 1970s which led to modern media
                authoring environments and common features of interface. Sutherland
                and his collaborators demonstrated with Sketchpad - the first
                interactive drawing system seen by the public.</p>
        
            <p>There is overall little documentation of the key systems with small
                black and white illustrations and just a few low resolution clips.</p>
        
            <p>The situation is quite different from media technologies, you could
                go to a museum to experience a real panorama from the 1840s. With
                computer systems, most ideas come from contemporary media studies but
                the original systems are not accesible. Though since there are a number
                of artists and programmers who work in 'Software Art' and 'Creative Coding',
                it should be possible to create emulations of a few fundamental systems.</p>
        
            <div class="title">An early concept in your book in Alan Kay's
                concept "Dynabook", which posited a computer as 'personal 
                dynamic media' to be used by all. It was brought into fruition 
                in the Xerox Alto computer, what importance can we attach to
                these images of users, interfaces and objects produced by these 
                systems?</div>
        
            <div class="width50">
                <img src="images/image3.pdf" alt="">
            </div>
        
            <p>The most informative images from the Dynabook appears in an article also
                written with Adele Goldberg in 1977. Kay suggested that computers can be
                a medium for personal expression.</p>
        
            <p>Alan Turing defined a computer as a machine that can simulate a large class
                of other machines. It was Kay and his generation that extended the idea of
                simulation to the media. In a book, it simulates existing media that has a
                chance to add and extend new functions. For example, an electronic book
                needs to be treated as a simulated paper book as it is a new medium with
                new properties.</p>
        
            <p>Many images of media software developed by Xerox team and other Alto users
                illustrate these ideas, Kay and Goldberg provided examples of their Dynabook
                that could allow users to paint, draw, animate, compose music and text. This
                makes Alto the first Universal Media Machine, a computer offering the ability
                to create experiences and artefacts in that sense.</p>
        
            <div class="title">I find it interesting your approach in analysing
                specific elements of interface and operations.
                Using the example of Sketchpad, was it not
                documentation that allowed for the argument
                that early software was not merely simulations
                of drawings but reinventions of it?</div>
        
            <div class="width50">
                <img src="images/image4.pdf" alt="">
            </div>
        
            <p>The Sketchpad demo has visceral impact. Where does it lead with analysis of</p>
            <p>Drawing, Film, Photography.</p>
        
            <p>The properties of different mediums are properties of media includes:</p>
            <p>Interface, tools and techniques they make possible for navigating, creating,</p>
            <p>editing, and sharing documents.</p>
        
            <p>For example, being able to change from Adobe Reader to Microsoft Word is not</p>
            <p>the property of text documents, but a result of software techniques.</p>
        
            <p>There are some media independent techniques such as the search bar, whereas</p>
            <p>some media specific are exclusive for some. For example, you can extrude a</p>
            <p>2 Dimensional shape to 3 Dimensions but not extrude text.</p>
        
            <div class="quote">I prefer to study the software and use this understanding</div>
            <div class="quote">in interpreting the content created through these medias</div>
            <div class="quote"> - tweets, messages, photos, designs, video games.</div>
        
            <p>All cultural forms which require a user to click even once, to access</p>
            <p>or participate. Therefore we can't ignore technology, therefore </p>
            <p>software takes command.</p>
